This project is part of 'The Odin Project' and demonstrates what is have learned so far. You presented a simple recipes websites where I give some of mine most loved dishes with a recipe.

The skills used in this project are Git, HTML5 and a bit of CSS.

Enjoy this project and let me know what you think of my 'first' website and of course the recipes.

Kind regards,

Melchior
