        Soto ayam is chicken noodle soup - Indonesian style. Lemongrass. Lime leaves. Ginger. Garlic. Spices. This is not your mom's chicken noodle soup.<br>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>Prepping:</h4>
        <p><wrap-text><strong>Prep the chicken</strong>
            Skin the chicken.
            Combine the stock, kaffir lime leaf, lemongrass and salt in a pot large enough to hold all the ingredients. Bring to a simmer.
            Add the chicken and simmer until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 170F. This should take 15-20 minutes. Don't boil. Simmer. Little bubbles.
            Remove the chicken from the broth. Blot dry. Set aside. You can also turn off the heat under the broth for now.<br><br>
            <strong>Make the spice paste</strong>
            While the chicken simmers make the spice paste.
            Heat a bit of oil in a small skillet. Add the garlic, shallot and ginger and fry until the shallots soften and start to colour up.
            Transfer the garlic, shallot and ginger to a blender. Add the remaining ingredients and puree. This is your spice paste.
            Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a pot over medium heat. When the oil starts to shimmer add the paste and cook, stirring constantly for about 5 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium low and cook for another two minutes or so. The oil should start to separate at the edges.
            Stir the cooked paste into the broth and stir.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Fry the chicken</strong>
            If you fried shallots just keep going with the chicken. If not heat around 2 cups of oil in a frying pan large enough to hold half the chicken (4 thighs). A spatter guard isn't a bad idea here if you have one.
            Fry on one side for about 2-3 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook another 2-3 minutes. You want the chicken to brown but you don't want to cook it to deathâ€¦Remove the chicken and repeat with the other 4 thighs. Set aside to cool enough to handle.
            When it's cool enough pull the chicken off the bone and shred it.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Medium boil the eggs</strong>
            Bring enough water to cover the eggs by one inch to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the eggs and set a timer. You want to cook them exactly seven minutes.
            After seven minutes remove them from the pan and submerge in an ice bath. This stops the eggs from cooking more. This should get you about a perfect medium boiled egg. Peel but don't slice them yet.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Assemble the soto ayam</strong>
            Bring the broth to a lively simmer. Taste it. Be careful. It's hot. It will need more salt. It will be somewhere around another 1/2 to full teaspoon. Maybe more. Season to your taste.
            To soften the rice vermicelli just fully submerge it in the hottest water you can get out of your tap. Let it sit five minutes and drain. Rinse with cold water. People that tell you to cook rice vermicelli like to eat rice noodle mush.
            Have your garnishes ready. Slice your eggs in half. Use a sharp knife and be careful. Those yolks are still soft.
            To serve place 1/4 of the rice noodles in each of 4 bowls. Divide the chicken and place it on the vermicelli. Top with fried shallots and cilantro. Pour 2 cups of broth into each bowl. Add one egg and a slice of lime per bowl. Serve. Add sambal oelek to taste. Enjoy.
